# Singular Value Decomposition

Image compression is becoming an increasingly pressing issue for high-tech communities. One such Image compression technique is the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). In the realm of digital imaging, SVD is an essential algebraic technique. Compressing Images using SVD minimizes the file size of the compressed image without sacrificing image quality. Also, in contrast with the source image, the compressed image consumes considerably less space. You may apply SVD to any symmetric, linear, or transposable matrix of size m x n. The SVD approach utilized in this work mainly focuses on compressing and minimizing the storage requirements. A successful compression of the image and its reconstruction depends on choosing the correct choices for the Eigenvalues. This study explores the applications of SVD, compositions and types of image compression algorithms using SVD while maintaining the resolution of an image as well as the MATLAB algorithm to encode an image.
